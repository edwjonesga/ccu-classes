# Stream-QL

## Assignment Instructions

Using the schema reference [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16FmWgXHp-Jj_JarRk-vCsmiYtQmNY6IUj2DpXf0N8dg/edit#slide=id.SLIDES_API963317716_5) and the SQL syntax reference [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sWq-pRfXJTcGcoQEKq-O8iOvpT5irTI9Xm12Qf8kQ84/edit#slide=id.g30088ebeae4_0_0)

Do the following:

1.  Write the SQL create statements for all the tables in the schema above.
2.  Be sure to create the foreign key references for all the tables (See slides on how to create foreign keys on table creation).
3.  Insert some some customers into the customer table.
4.  Insert some payment methods into the payment method table.
5.  Write an SQL query to figure out which customers don't have payment methods.
6.  Write an SQL query to figure out how much monthly money we are making from customers in NY (or whatever state you choose).
7.  Write an SQL query to figure out how many ***active*** (i.e. not just in my playlist) listeners each artist has. Extra credit. Break it out by state.

**Hint**: There is nothing that says you can only join two tables.

**Note**: Minor modifications to the in the schema based on your preference is acceptable. e.g. Change column names, change of how values are stored.

## Inserting Data

Insert strategically so that you can complete the query part of the assignment.

You will have to insert data across dependent tables and query across dependent tables as well.

Make sure to insert some records into the stream transaction table so we can do some fun queries.

Its a bit of a stretch assignment so feel free to ask questions in class or swing by [office hours](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ1rb6tTvz-8fds48Jm5KQbAPvhmBAGUAuItYAskZ6WfNh3FsLMbEFYkpoKdOxhHbeD35z7SajZA).
